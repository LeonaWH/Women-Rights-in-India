# Women-Rights-in-India
A web-based platform was created to address the pervasive problems of gender-based discrimination and violence against women. The portal offers
a thorough database of laws and previous judgements relevant to women's rights. By including cutting-edge capabilities like a chatbot system
powered by natural language processing, it goes beyond a static repository. The portal also makes use of machine learning techniques to produce
pertinent case search results in response to user requests.
